	Problem Statement
	Given two lists of intervals, find the intersection of these two lists.
	Each list consists of disjoint intervals sorted on their start time.
	
	Example 1:
	
	Input: arr1=[[1, 3], [5, 6], [7, 9]], arr2=[[2, 3], [5, 7]]
	Output: [2, 3], [5, 6], [7, 7]
	Explanation: The output list contains the common intervals between the two lists.
	
	Example 2:
	
	Input: arr1=[[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 12]], arr2=[[5, 10]]
	Output: [5, 7], [9, 10]
	Explanation: The output list contains the common intervals between the two lists.
